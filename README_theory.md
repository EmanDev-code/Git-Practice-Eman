# Part 1: Theoretical Questions

## 1. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

- **Git** is a program that helps me keep track of changes in my project files on my computer.  
- **GitHub** is a website where I can upload my project and share it with others to work together.

## 2. Explain the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`.

- **git fetch** downloads updates from the internet but does not change my local files.  
- **git pull** downloads updates and updates my local files immediately.

## 3. What is the purpose of `.gitignore` file?

- The `.gitignore` file lists files or folders that I don't want Git to track or upload, like private or temporary files.

## 4. Describe the steps to contribute to an open-source project on GitHub.

1. Choose a project on GitHub to contribute to.  
2. Make a copy of the project (Fork) to my account.  
3. Download the project to my computer (Clone).  
4. Create a new branch to work on.  
5. Make the changes I want.  
6. Save the changes (Commit).  
7. Upload the changes to my GitHub copy (Push).  
8. Open a Pull Request for the project owners.  
9. If they approve, they merge my changes into the original project.
